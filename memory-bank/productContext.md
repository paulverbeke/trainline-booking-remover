## Product Context

### Why This Exists

Many travel booking sites preselect promotional offers or hotel search options
that open extra tabs or add unwanted steps. The project exists to remove that
friction while preserving user choice.

### Problems It Solves

- Avoids accidental opt-ins to promotional offers.
- Prevents unexpected hotel search tabs from opening.
- Reduces repetitive manual unchecking on each visit.

### User Experience Goals

- Checkboxes are unchecked once when they appear on the page.
- If a user re-enables an option, it remains enabled for that session.
- Works quietly and does not change unrelated page behavior.
